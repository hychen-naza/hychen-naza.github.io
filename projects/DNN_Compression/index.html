  Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been recently applied to synthetic
  aperture radar (SAR) for automatic target recognition (ATR) and have achieved state-of-the-art results
  with significantly improved recognition performance. However, the training period of deep CNN is
  long, and the size of the network is huge, sometimes reaching hundreds of megabytes. These two
  factors of deep CNN hinders its practical implementation and deployment in real-time SAR platforms
  that are typically resource-constrained. To address this challenge, this paper presents three strategies
  of network compression and acceleration to decrease computing and memory resource dependencies
  while maintaining a competitive accuracy. First, we introduce a new weight-based network pruning
  and adaptive architecture squeezing method to reduce the network storage and the time of inference
  and training process, meanwhile maintain a balance between compression ratio and classification
  accuracy. Then we employ weight quantization and coding to compress the network storage space.
  Due to the fact that the amount of calculation is mainly reflected in the convolution layer, a fast
  approach for pruned convolutional layers is proposed to reduce the number of multiplication by
  exploiting the sparsity in the activation inputs and weights. Experimental results show that the
  convolutional neural networks for SAR-ATR can be compressed by 40 × without loss of accuracy,
  and the number of multiplication can be reduced by 15 × . Combining these strategies, we can easily
  load the network in resource-constrained platforms, speed up the inference process to get the results
  in real-time or even retrain a more suitable network with new image data in a specific situation.
